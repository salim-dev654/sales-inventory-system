# SQL Practice – Practical SQL (2nd Edition)

This repository contains my hands-on SQL practice while learning from
*Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data (2nd Edition)*
by Anthony DeBarros.

## Topics Covered
- SELECT statements
- ORDER BY and sorting
- DISTINCT values
- WHERE filtering
- Logical operators (AND, OR)
- Pattern matching using LIKE and ILIKE

## Notes
All queries were written and tested manually as part of my SQL learning journey
to understand real database behavior and query logic.
